# ImagePickerInator

do you have to many photos of your kids, friends or cats? more then half of which are complete trash, or duplicates? 
this program goes through all of them, bunches them up into groups that were taken at roughly the same time, 
and allowes you to cherry pick the ones you want from the mess.

TODO:
- intro / tutorial
- button that rotates the image view
- save image rotations to copied files
